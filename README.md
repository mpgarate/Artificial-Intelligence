Artificial-Intelligence
=======================

4 assignments I created for Professor Ernest Davis' Spring 2014 Artificial Intelligence class. 

We were allowed to use a language of our choice for these assignments. This is a rare opportunity to use Javascript and Ruby in an undergraduate CS class (Java, C, C++ more typical). 

See subdirectories for more detailed READMEs. 

#### 1 - CYK Parser
CYK Parser for a provided context-free grammar and lexicon written in Javascript.

#### 2 - Travelling Salesman
Salesman Hill Climbing written in Javascript. 

#### 3 - Davis-Putnam
Logic generator and solver for a basic strategy game, written in Ruby. 

#### 4 - Naive Bayes Text Classifier
Biography classifier using Naive Bayes, written in Ruby.
